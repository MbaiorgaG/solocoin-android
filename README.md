# Corona Go
Corona GO is a mobile app that rewards users to engage in social-distancing. 
(Social distancing is a term applied to certain actions [mostly staying away from other people] that are taken by Public Health officials to stop or slow down the spread of a highly contagious disease.)
The rewards earned can later be redeemed for Amazon, Swiggy, medicine, etc. coupons (mostly to help them stay at home).

## Why this idea?

COVID-19 has severely affected the livelihoods of the people around the globe. 
It's proven that the single most effective way to prevent the spread of COVID-19 is social-distancing. BUT, not many people are practicing social-distancing. Most of them are simply ignoring the government's guidance. I’m a co-founder at Blockchain gaming company. I have a lot of experience in implementing game mechanics in consumer apps. So, I thought why not apply the same gamification techniques I implement in blockchain, into a consumer app to incentivize people to engage in social distancing.

## Why am I focusing so much on "Social-distancing" and not other means of preventive measures like washing hands, not touching anything, etc.?

1. In theory, never leaving home during the coronavirus pandemic is the most effective means of prevention. It reduces your chance of infection and quickly contains the disease’s spread. A recent study in Science found, for example, that this kind of distancing is even better than widespread travel bans or restrictions.

2. Bill Gates suggested social-distancing the most effective method to contain COVID-19 in his recent Reddit AMA.
